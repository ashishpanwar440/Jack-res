		<span class="fatText headerKindaFat">Introduction to Recipe Rating System Chart</span><br/><br/>
		In order to better help you identify recipes that feature a high concentration of nutrients for the calories they 
		contain, we created a Recipe Rating System. This system allows us to highlight the recipes that are especially 
		rich in particular nutrients. The following chart shows the nutrients for which 15-Minute Greek Garbanzo Bean Salad
		is either an excellent, very good, or good source (below the chart you will find a table that explains these 
		qualifications). If a nutrient is not listed in the chart, it does not necessarily mean that the recipe doesn't 
		contain it. It simply means that the nutrient is not provided in a sufficient amount or concentration to meet 
		our rating criteria. (To view this recipe's in-depth nutritional profile that includes values for dozens of 
		nutrients - not just the ones rated as excellent, very good, or good - please use the link below the chart.) 
		To read this chart accurately, you'll need to glance back up to see the ingredients used in the recipe and the 
		number of serving sizes provided by the recipe. Our nutrient ratings are based on a single serving. For example, 
		if a recipe makes 4 servings, you would be receiving the nutrient amounts listed in the chart by eating 1/4th of 
		the combined ingredients found in the recipe. Now, returning to the chart itself, you can look next to the nutrient 
		name in order to find the nutrient amount it offers, the percent Daily Value (DV%) that this amount represents, the 
		nutrient density that we calculated for this recipe and nutrient, and the rating we established in our rating system. 
		For most of our nutrient ratings, we adopted the government standards for food labeling that are found in the U.S. 
		Food and Drug Administration's "Reference Values for Nutrition Labeling." <a href="http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=faq&amp;dbid=22">
